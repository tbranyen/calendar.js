Development is fully commented source, Production is minified and stripped of
all comments except for license/credits.

Include in your application.

``` html
<script src="/js/calendar.js"></script>
```

## Usage ##

This will show how to create a new `Calendar` instance, configure, and render
it into the page `Document`.

### Creating a new Calendar instance ###

To create a new Calendar instance to configure:

``` javascript
// Must pass in either a DOMNode or a string selector.
var cal = new Calendar(".calendar");

// Call init once you have finished binding event handlers and changed options.
cal.init();
```

### Change default tag and class names ###

If you wish to change default tag and class names simply override them on the
`options` object.

Changing the element types that are created is this simple (useful if you want
to avoid having `<table/>`'s built):

``` javascript
// Overriding only a specific tagName property.
cal.options.tagName.month = "div";

// Overriding all tagName properties.
cal.options.tagName = {
  month: "table",
  week: "tr",
  day: "td"
};
```

Changing the class name's used is done in the manner:

``` javascript
// Overriding only a specific className property.
cal.options.className.month = "month";

// Overriding all className properties.
cal.options.className = {
  month: "month",
  week: "week",
  day: "day"
};
```

### Utilizing custom Calendar events ###

There are several events you can listen to, which can be used to update your UI
accordingly.

* `initialize` is triggered once the calendar is created
* `update` is triggered after the `update` function is called
* `beforeRender` is triggered before rendering starts
* `afterRender` is triggered after rendering ends

An example of when binding to an event can be useful:

``` javascript
// Update a month label with the current calendar month.
cal.on("update", function(cal) {
  $(".month").html(cal.date.getFullMonth());
});
```

You can create and trigger custom events, using `on` and `trigger` functions
respectively.
